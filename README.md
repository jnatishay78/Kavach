Healthcare workers rely on personal protective equipment to protect themselves and their patients from being infected and infecting others.To build the website I have chosen Azure Cloud Platform with FAQ Bot deployed on Website for customers help.


##### Project Description: 
The title and tagline clearly depict the basic idea of the project, which is a product catalogue website for Hygiene Products for Covid-19 prevention and propagation. It is hard to find PPE items such as hand sanitiser, face shields or digital thermometers, so we created its catalogue which contains all information about variety of such products.
